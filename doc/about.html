<h2><strong>GUI Overview</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Config Basics</b> tab: input parameters common to all models (e.g., domain grid, simulation time, choice/frequency of outputs)</li>
<li><b>Microenvironment</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp; microenvironment parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>User Params</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>Out: Plots</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output display of cells and substrates</li>
</ul>
Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress (text) of the simulation. When the simulation generates output file(s),
they can be visualized in the appropriate output tabs. The "Max" count in each output tab will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.


<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

<p>
This app demonstrates how you can model run an intracellular model along with PhysiCell. It uses libRoadrunner
to read/process a SBML file that represents the intracellular model and also to solve the SBML model. 
In this particular model, our SBML contains a set of ODEs. The app is still in the 
development stage. In particular, even though the Upload widget for a SBML file is 
enabled, it will not be used yet.

<p>This model and cloud-hosted demo are part of a course on computational multicellular systems biology created and taught by 
    Dr. Paul Macklin in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Indiana University. It is also part of the education 
    and outreach for the IU Engineered nanoBIO Node and the NCI-funded cancer systems biology grant U01CA232137. 
    The models are built using <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991" target="_blank">PhysiCell</a>: 
    a C++ framework for multicellular systems biology [1].</p>


<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Basic instructions</a></h2>

<p>Modify the parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot; and &quot;User Params&quot; tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once ready.</p>

<p>To view the output results, click the &quot;Out:Plots&quot; tab, and click/drag the slider to advance through simulation frames. (You can also use the left/right arrow buttons to move the slider if it's selected.)
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will increase, so you can view more simulation frames. You can toggle on/off the display of either cells or substrates, assuming you selected them to be computed in the &quot;Config Basics&quot; tab. And you can select different substrates and different colormaps from the dropdown widgets.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
